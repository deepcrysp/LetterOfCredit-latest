/**
 * An purchase order is a document that describes a trade between a buyer and a seller. It is issued on a particular
 * date, it lists goods being sold by the seller, the cost of each good and the total amount owed by the buyer and when
 * the seller expects to be paid by.
 *
 * In the trade finance world, purchase orders are used to create other contracts (for example AccountsReceivable),
 * newly created purchase orders start off with a status of "unassigned", once they're used to create other contracts
 * the status is changed to "assigned". This ensures that an purchase order is used only once when creating a financial
 * product like AccountsReceivable.
