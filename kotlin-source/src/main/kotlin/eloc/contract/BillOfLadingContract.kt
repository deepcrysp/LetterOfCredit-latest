/**
 * A bill of lading is a standard-form document. It is transferable by endorsement (or by lawful transfer of possession)
 * and is a receipt from shipping company regarding the number of packages with a particular weight and markings and a
 * contract for the transportation of same to a port of destination mentioned therein.
 *
 * An order bill of lading is used when shipping merchandise prior to loc, requiring a carrier to deliver the
 * merchandise to the importer, and at the endorsement of the exporter the carrier may transfer title to the importer.
 * Endorsed order bills of lading can be traded as a security or serve as collateral against debt obligations.
